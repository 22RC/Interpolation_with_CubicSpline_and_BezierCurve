# Interpolation_with_CubicSpline_and_BezierCurve


Simple program for polynomial interpolation with cubic Spline and Bèzier curves.

The various tests are present in the repository. The tests have been developed for all types of cubic splines and for bèzier curves.


If you want to use this program, you need to install the following libraries:

-numpy (see this link https://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpy);
-scipy (see this link https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html);


Attached there is a report of the work done, unfortunately in Italian (when I will have free time I translate it into English)
